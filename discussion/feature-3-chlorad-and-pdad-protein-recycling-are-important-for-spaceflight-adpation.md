# Feature 3: CHLORAD and PDAD protein recycling are important for spaceflight adpation

#### Feature 3: “SAY1 and Unknown protein degradation / chloroplast response to light in space feature” <a href="#cp8k6b6kfmmz" id="cp8k6b6kfmmz"></a>

Feature #3 is associated with 2 genes, _DUF716_, which is a domain of unknown function proteins that is annotated as being membrane bound and involved in the response to light stimulus. There are 6 members in duf716 family, all are part of the membrane interactome and are annotated as being are of the plant viral response system and capable with physically interacting with \`TET2 “tetraspanin 2” a protein complex (Jones et al., 2014). This here to overlooked loci is differentially expressed in BRIC19 etiolated seedling and contributes to the 'highlight response' cluster, which includes HSPs involved in misfolded protein recycling response in the ER (Choi et al., 2019). As Seeds germinate in BRICs when temperature conditions become favourable for seed germination, resulting in higher levels of GA accumulation. Plants subsequently grow in darkness, leading to GA deficiency in their roots while hypocotyls elongate. The GA-Gibberellin insensitive dwarf1 (GID) complex binds to DELLA, leading to its ubiquitination by the F-box protein SLY1 and SCF E3 ligase-mediated degradation via the proteasome. This process stabilizes TOC159. Upon destruction of DELLA, TOC159 becomes available for assembly into the TOC complex, facilitating full import of photosynthesis-associated proteins into chloroplasts. Such a mechanism enables a rapid switch from heterotrophic to photoautotrophic growth (visible as seedling greening) when conditions allow. Chloroplast biogenesis is crucial for plant growth through photosynthesis as it involves transforming non-photosynthetic proplastids into green, photosynthetically active chloroplasts during early stages of plant development such as germination. A key component in this process is a receptor called TOC159 that plays an essential role. Mutations in TOC159 can prevent chloroplast biogenesis and result in albino plants. Gibberellic acid (GA), a plant hormone necessary for germination, represses chloroplast biogenesis under low GA concentrations. One NULL name locus AT5G48020 is a 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase protein that was differentially expressed in response to radiation (Culligan et al., 2007). Recent research has shown that GA perception leads to degradation of TOC159 by the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) through interaction with DELLA proteins, which negatively regulate TOC159 abundance under low GA levels (Shanmugabalaji et al., 2018)."

#### SAY1 and the Role of PUX Proteins in Protein Homeostasis and Cellular Response Mechanisms <a href="#qmtmmqomwzc0" id="qmtmmqomwzc0"></a>

The other loci associated with feature #2 is SAY1 (also known as PUX8), a Ubiquitin-like superfamily protein previously responsive to ionizing radiation (Culligan et al., 2006). GO biological processes describe SAY1's involvement in vesicular-mediated transport and its role in protein maturation or degradation en route to the cytosol of the cell wall, potentially via PD. The PUX family consists of 16 members in Arabidopsis and is part of the regulatory statement of AAA-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) Cell Division Control Protein 48 (CDC48). These enzymes utilize ATP hydrolysis energy to pull, extract, and unfold ubiquitylated or sumoylated proteins from membranes, chromatin, or protein complexes. CDC48 activity and targeting are controlled by adaptor proteins, with PUX proteins being the largest family among them. By translocating and eliminating proteins from different cellular locations, CDC48/p97 acts as a rapid response mechanism to changing conditions. This leads to changes in protein or RNA content that help plants maintain protein homeostasis and respond to dynamic environmental conditions. PUX adaptor proteins target CDC48 to distinct organelles, thereby regulating membrane-associated protein translocation and degradation. CDC48-mediated protein degradation has been associated with various mechanisms such as Chloroplast Associated Degradation (CHLORAD), Lipid Droplet Associated Degradation (LDAD), Endoplasmic Reticulum Associated Degradation (ERAD), Inner Nuclear Membrane (INM), and autophagy in plants. While evidence directly linking specific PUX proteins to CHLORAD and ERAD remains weak (Zhang et al., 2021).

#### CHLORAD and PDAD: Protein Degradation Pathways and the Role of E3 Ubiquitin Ligases in Cellular Response Mechanisms <a href="#id-7gldkjne0gqp" id="id-7gldkjne0gqp"></a>

The insights gathered by Ling et al. (2012) provided glimpses of a protein removal pathway now coined CHLORAD (chloroplast-associated protein degradation) in their latest study (Ling et al., 2019). CHLORAD shares similarities with the ERAD system operating at the endoplasmic reticulum (Wu and Rapoport, 2018). It involves targeted deviation of TIC or TOC related proteins. Our analysis identifies a PD-associated degradation (PDAD) mediated spaceflight response and potential changes in a SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) ubiquitin ligase protein complex. This complex attaches ubiquitin molecules to specific target proteins for subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. The F-box protein within the complex binds specific substrates, enabling attachment of ubiquitin molecules. The SCF system exhibits versatility with multiple interchangeable variants of F-box proteins that recognize diverse substrates. A study by Guo et al., (2022) demonstrated that E3 Ubiquitin Ligase ATL9 affects expression of defense-related genes involved in programmed cell death and callose deposition during fungal infection. These findings highlight the role of E3 ubiquitin ligases in regulating defense-related genes and cellular responses to fungal infections. Understanding cullin ubiquitin ligase/protein degradation systems provides insights into how targeted protein turnover influences gene expression regulation and cellular functions under different physiological conditions.

#### Radiation signature in the data: Exploring the Complexities of Plant Responses to Ionizing Radiation: Challenges, Variability, and Potential Implications for Space Agriculture <a href="#gdfkay3oodef" id="gdfkay3oodef"></a>

Many of the genes identified during this analysis were also differentials abundant in radiation response assays performed by Culligan et al., (2007). Plants exhibit various responses to ionizing radiation, including cellular, molecular, genetic, and physiological changes. Life in low earth orbit (LEO) and the Martian or Lunar surface is constantly exposed to a high dose of cosmic radiation consisting of highly energetic particles and multiple types of ionizing radiation (Tack et al., 2021, Barker et al. 2021). The dose can increase temporarily by a factor of 50 through the occurrence of highly energetic solar flares, which may affect crop growth in greenhouses on the Martian surface and potentially complicate human settlement (Tack et al., 2021). High doses of gamma irradiation can affect the preservation potential of biomarkers in cyanobacteria, such as carotenoids, which are important biosignatures (Baqué et al., 2018).

The effects of ionizing radiation on plants can vary depending on factors such as the type of radiation (acute or chronic), dose rate or dose applied, species, varieties, cultivars, stage of development, and individual variations (Ludovici et al., 2022). Ionizing radiation can have drastic effects on cell division in the meristem or germline of plants (Ludovici et al., 2022). However, it is challenging to compare plant responses to ionizing radiation due to the differences in experimental conditions and parameters (Ludovici et al., 2022). Plants in spaceflight are also subjected to other environmental stresses, including a range of abiotic and biotic stresses (Gull et al., 2019). Stresses trigger a wide range of plant responses, including altered gene expression, changes in cellular metabolism, growth rates, and crop yields (Gull et al., 2019). It is important to note that the response to ionizing radiation in plants can vary depending on the species studied (Ludovici et al., 2022). Standardization schemes are emerging to predict a standard response to ionizing radiation in plants, but it remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of plant responses (Ludovici et al., 2022).

More future radiation research is needed, it is essential to expand the scope of these concepts by including simulated galactic cosmic ray, proton, and neutron beams in addition to gamma and HZE radiation treatments. This broader matrix of radiation types will provide a more comprehensive understanding of their effects and contribute to advancements in our knowledge of cellular responses to various forms of radiation exposure.
