#### Investigating the Impact of CO2 Concentration on Stomatal Function and Epidermal Development in Plants Exposed to Spaceflight Stressors <a href="#mm4zyvejgxjb" id="mm4zyvejgxjb"></a>

The lack of convective mixing of gasses has previously been proposed to cause regions of elevated CO2 around the surface of plants in plants in space (Ma et al., 2021). We further validate these theories as Plant GSAD enrichment analysis of the features identified by our precision treatment model showed significance similarly to studies involving elevated CO2 levels. Fortunately chloroplasts are able to adapt to process these metabolites as reviewed prevails by Hughesl and Kiss (2022). However, evaluating CO2 does more than just increase the rate of energy production from photosynthesis, it also has the potential to affect stoma function and density. The stomata are pores on leaves that exchange gasses between the leaf and the atmosphere. When the stomata close, less water is lost and there is lower transpiration. Increased CO2 concentration can cause guard cells to close stomata. This is because the higher CO2 concentration increases the acidity of the guard cells. The increased acidity causes the guard cells to become flaccid, which closes the stomata. The higher CO2 concentration also enhances the activity of anion channels in the guard cells. These channels mediate the extrusion of ions during stomatal closure and the plant has long-term adaptation protocols to optimize water and gaseous exchange. Interestingly, there was a significant correlation with cluster 8 from a single-cell resolution analysis of lineage trajectories in the Arabidopsis stomatal lineage and developing leaf (Lopez-Anido et al., 2021). This suggests that changes in leaf epidermal development may be part of the response to stressors associated with spaceflight-related treatments. Additionally, Bates et al., (2012) showed significant similarity as they conducted a comparative study of guard cell and leaf transcriptomes, highlighting their responsiveness to sucrose. Taken together this could mean that changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations are altering the plants carbon metabolism and secular availability which may be resulting in epidermal changes to the epidermis.

**Elicit mined: Radish phenotypes associated with elevated CO2**

“The papers collectively suggest that changes in CO2 levels have an effect on radishes, but the findings regarding the comparison to spaceflight samples are limited. Gohil et al., (2010) found that increasing CO2 levels reduced transpiration rates and enhanced radish growth, but high CO2 levels also caused leaf damage. Urbonavičiūtė et al., (2006) showed that elevated CO2 concentrations increased carbohydrate content and chlorophyll levels in radish leaves. Sanggyu et al., 2009 found that elevated CO2 levels improved photosynthesis and starch content in radishes, but elevated temperature conditions had negative effects. Chu et al., (2004) demonstrated that increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations enhanced biomass accumulation and resource acquisition in radish, but did not affect biomass partitioning between roots and shoots. However, none of the papers directly compared the effects of CO2 changes on radishes to spaceflight samples.”

#### Impact of Elevated CO2 and Environmental Stressors on Photosynthesis, Respiration, and Antioxidant Systems in Plants <a href="#px8173ug8ndd" id="px8173ug8ndd"></a>

The response and adaptation of photosynthesis, respiration and related antioxidant systems to elevated CO2 with environmental stressors in plants as elevated CO2 (eCO2) can significantly impact plant metabolism (reviewed by Xu et al., (2015)). Rubisco is an enzyme involved in photosynthesis that facilitates carboxylation and oxygenation reactions. Elevated CO2 levels can promote carboxylation while repressing oxygenation under favorable environmental conditions like well-watered conditions. Extreme abiotic stress factors such as heat and drought can have contrasting effects on Rubisco activity. They may repress carboxylation but promote oxygenation, which can affect plant metabolic processes.The balance between different metabolic cycles within plants might be influenced by elevated CO2 levels, leading to a trade-off in energy consumption between these cycles. Photorespiration, a process that helps protect against reactive oxygen species (ROS), could be promoted under elevated CO2 levels. Elevated CO2 levels can enhance Water use efficiency (WUE) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) despite reduced nitrogen availability, by decreasing stomatal conductance and allocating more nitrogen into the Rubisco protein. The photorespiration process occurs in multiple organelles including chloroplasts, peroxisomes, and mitochondria, with its stimulation or suppression being influenced by rising CO2 concentrations. Elevated CO2 may help mitigate oxidative stress caused by abiotic stresses like heat, drought, and ozone exposure through enhancing antioxidant defense systems involving non-enzymatic compounds like ascorbate and glutathione along with relevant enzymes such as SOD, APX, DHAR, GR etc., which scavenge harmful ROS generated during stressful conditions potentially alleviating oxidative stress damage. Under elevated CO2 conditions, there may be increased electron flux towards the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle for photosynthesis, while less electron flow may occur in other pathways like photorespiration, xanthophyll cycle, and methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway (MEP), affecting the synthesis of compounds like isoprene and redox reactions involved in ROS quenching (Xu et al., 2015).

It’s unclear how changes to the carbon content of the media such as variations in sucrose, acetate or other KREB cycle substrate might have on the plants net metabolic balance and resulting thermodynamic temperature (Exothermic - endothermic). (Supplementary figure showing sucrose related metabolism in a minimal metabolic model is used to illustrate the complexity of the net carbon ) However, what is clear is many of the loci that respond to spaceflight have been shown to be responsive to temperature stress. An example of one of these thermally responsive unnamed proteins is loci AT4G32080, not much is currently known about this unnamed protein, other than it is predicted to be targeted to the mitochondria and has been shown to respond transcriptionally to cold and osmotic stress.

#### Alternation to circadian rhythm may explain heat and cold stress responses in space <a href="#c2zdtomxe5vb" id="c2zdtomxe5vb"></a>

Organisms have developed internal timekeeping systems known as circadian rhythms, or “biological clocks”. They are found in all organisms, from bacteria to eukaryotes. These mechanisms evolved on Earth to synchronize metabolic processes to oscillate on 24 hour cycles while integrating information about the external environment to optimize growth and survival. Circadian rhythms regulate many cellular processes that can influence charged ion distribution at cellular levels influencing tissue morphology and whole organism development responses. Many genes that are responsive to ROS also exhibit time-of-day-specific expression patterns under diurnal and circadian conditions; potentially just as part of the response to highlight levels at midday but also potentially indicating that the circadian clock is regulating transcription to prepare the plants for these predictable temporal variations in cellular ROS concentrations.

The production and scavenging of hydrogen peroxide, a type of ROS, also show distinct phases throughout the day. Lea et al., (2012) used mutations in CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1), a core-clock regulator, to show the transcriptional regulation of ROS-responsive genes. CCA1 is proposed as a key regulator of ROS homeostasis by associating with specific DNA elements called “Evening Elements” in promoters of genes involved in ROS metabolism. This coordination allows plants to respond appropriately to oxidative stress based on the time-dependent cues provided by their biological clocks. The circadian clock regulates ROS production, scavenging, and transcription of ROS-responsive genes have also been linked to controls of mitochondrial energy, ROS and heat production. Genome ontology analysis of the collective machine learning feature also identified significant similarity to Kendall et al., (2011), a study that compared the effect of different temperatures to investigate the effect of elevated metabolism on seed dormancy. This is particularly interesting as the response to heat is a constant component of the spaceflight environment and was first identified by Zupanska et al., (2013) investigated non-differentiated hypocotyls cells under spaceflight conditions, revealing induction of heat shock proteins (HSP). They hypothesized a potential role for HSP-related proteins in maintaining cytoskeletal architecture and cell shape signaling under microgravity conditions. But has now been reported in many more studies which were recently reviewed by Mayers and Wyatt (2022).
