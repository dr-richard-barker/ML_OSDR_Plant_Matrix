Feature #1: “Tissue-specific respiratory adaptation”

Feature 1 was the largest feature and had significant correlation for elevated CO2 using GSAD co-expression analysis. Feature 1 consists of approximately 8888 loci that provide insights into tissue type and accession information. This extensive list of loci encompasses a diverse range of biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular sites related to plant growth and adaptation to spaceflight-related stressors. Analysis of the AGRIS transcription factor (TF) target database revealed a significant enrichment of known PIF3 targets. PIF3 is a phytochrome-interacting factor known for its involvement in light signaling pathways. The presence of enrichment for TF targets suggests that PIF3 plays a role in coordinating gene expression patterns associated with specific tissue types or developmental stages. GO cellular sites associated with Feature 2 include chloroplasts, which are responsible for photosynthesis, as well as membranes involved in photosynthetic and redox-related processes. This indicates the importance of capturing information about these key organelles involved in energy production. Furthermore, Feature #1 encompasses aspects such as respiration, primary carbon metabolism, amino acid/nitrate/ammonium transporters and may influence organelle or apoplast acidity (supplementary figure xxx). This regulation highlights the significance of metabolic processes related to nutrient uptake and utilization while experiencing spaceflight-related stressors.

Plants are highly sensitive to even small temperature differences and adjust their growth and development via various mechanisms that can lead to changes in organ &/or tissue function; these changes in architecture morphology induced by high ambient temperatures are collectively referred to as thermomorphogenesis. The transcription factor PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4) has been identified as a key regulator of phytohormone levels and activity involved in controlling thermomorphogenesis (Carolin et al., (2022)). Multiple hormonal regulatory circuits exist to modulate PIF4 activity both upstream and downstream. Integrating thermal monitoring systems into processes is influenced by various light signaling pathways such as gravity, light, internal sugar reserves and the circadian clock via a range of epigenetic and chromatin-level mechanisms. It is interesting to consider that PIF3 and PIF4 are likely to have redundant roles; could the pif3 target enrichment be due to the detection of internal heat stress caused by changes to oxidative phosphorylation during respiration and/or photosynthesis. Alternatively, another potential reason for correlation with PIF3 promoter targets could be related to its role in the regulation of photo and skotomorphogenesis reflecting the combination of both light and dark-grown plant tissues. Leivar and Monte (2014) have previously reviewed the role the PIF family plays integrating a wide array of environmental signals through modulation of hormonal metabolism and signaling.

#### Sucrose Sensing in Developmental Growth and Epigenetic Regulation under Spaceflight Conditions <a href="#yvzvt0r726fl" id="yvzvt0r726fl"></a>

Plant GSAD enrichment analysis (Ma et al., 2021) identified a statistical association between the precision treatment model and the RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED protein (RBR). RBR is known to play a crucial role in the developmental switch from embryonic heterotrophic growth to autotrophic growth (Gutzat et al., 2011). RBR acts antagonistically to sucrose by negatively regulating the cell cycle and repressing embryonic genes in response to sucrose availability. One of the loci that contributed to this association was an unnamed protein, AT4G37220, that is a part of the Cold inducible pathway, its molecular functions in the mitochondria is not known, however, it has been shown to respond transcriptionally to sucrose addition. This may indicate that the sugar levels have an influence on the rate of developmental growth and this has influenced the spaceflight treatment model. To gain deeper insights into the role of RBR in development, further research is necessary, such as investigating how sugar levels affect RBR expression and activity during simulated cosmic ray exposures, microgravity simulations or elevated atmospheric CO2. Correlation analysis using Plant GSAD enrichment analysis (Ma et al., 2021) also provides evidence linking sucrose sensing to H3K4ME3 methylation, which is known to change during seedling development between (4 days (d) and 10 d), and which ultimately influences flowering time (Roudier et al., 2011). In a similar study, Englehorn et al., (2007) also analyzed histone methyltransferase activity specific for H3-K4me3, demonstrating its involvement in chromatin dynamics regulation during floral morphogenesis. These findings support previous assertions that space flight may induce accelerated ageing of plant cells, observed through epigenetic changes (Paul et al., 2021).
