Feature #1: “Tissue-specific respiratory adaptation”

Feature 1 stands out in our dataset for its substantial correlation with elevated CO2 levels, identified through GSAD co-expression analysis, comprising a wide-ranging collection of approximately 8,888 loci. This collection offers invaluable insights into several biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular locations critical for plant growth and adjustment to spaceflight-induced stress. Notably, the analysis of the AGRIS transcription factor (TF) target database has highlighted a significant enrichment for PIF3 targets, a phytochrome-interacting factor vital in light signaling pathways, suggesting its pivotal role in managing gene expression related to specific tissue types or developmental stages. Furthermore, the GO cellular site enrichment chloroplasts and membranes through Feature 2 underscores the importance of these organelles in photosynthesis and energy production processes during spaceflight. Feature 1 also encapsulates essential aspects such as respiration, primary carbon metabolism, and various transport mechanisms, pointing to its regulatory impact on organelle or apoplast acidity—a factor crucial for understanding nutrient uptake and utilization under spaceflight conditions. Altogether, the correlation of Feature 1 with CO2 levels, coupled with the role of PIF3 and the emphasis on chloroplasts and metabolic processes, lays a solid foundation for further research into plant adaptation strategies in space.&#x20;

Plants exhibit a remarkable sensitivity to slight variations in temperature, systematically altering their growth and development through numerous mechanisms that consequently modify the functionality of organs and tissues. These architectural and morphological transformations triggered by elevated ambient temperatures are collectively termed thermomorphogenesis. Research highlights the transcription factor PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4) as a pivotal mediator in the modulation of phytohormone concentrations and activities that govern thermomorphogenesis (Carolin et al., 2022). The regulation of PIF4 involves complex hormonal regulatory circuits, both preceding and succeeding its activity. The integration of thermal monitoring systems within these processes is modulated by a variety of light signaling pathways, including those governed by gravity, light, internal sugar reserves, and the circadian clock, through an assortment of epigenetic and chromatin-level mechanisms.

It is noteworthy to consider the possibility that PIF3 and PIF4 might perform overlapping functions. This redundancy in roles may elucidate the enrichment of targets in the pif3 promoter, potentially attributable to the detection of internal heat stress brought forth by alterations in oxidative phosphorylation during respiration and/or photosynthesis. Alternatively, the correlation with PIF3 promoter targets could also be linked to its regulatory capacity over photomorphogenesis and skotomorphogenesis, indicative of its role in the assimilation of light and dark conditions in plant tissues. Leivar and Monte (2014) comprehensively reviewed the integral role of the PIF family in synthesizing diverse environmental cues through the modulation of hormonal metabolism and signaling pathways.

### Unraveling the Influence of RBR and sugar levels on plant development during spaceflight

In the groundbreaking study by Ma et al. (2021), GSAD enrichment analysis unveiled a statistically significant correlation between advanced precision treatment models and the pivotal RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR) protein. RBR's critical function is underscored by its role in the developmental transition from embryonic heterotrophic to autotrophic growth (Gutzat et al., 2011). Notably, RBR modulates the cell cycle in opposition to sucrose, repressing embryonic genes in response to sucrose availability, thus impacting development.

A noteworthy locus connected to this association is an undeclared protein, AT4G37220, identified within the Cold inducible pathway. Despite its unspecified molecular functions in mitochondria, transcriptional responsiveness to sucrose addition suggests a potential regulation of developmental pace by sugar levels, a notion reinforced by findings from spaceflight treatment models.

To elucidate RBR's role in plant development further, comprehensive research, encompassing the exploration of sugar levels on RBR expression and function during simulated outer space conditions, including cosmic ray exposures and microgravity simulations, in addition to elevated atmospheric CO2 environments, is imperative.

Additionally, GSAD enrichment analysis (Ma et al., 2021) elucidates a connection between sucrose sensing and H3K4ME3 methylation, a process known to alter during seedling development stages (4 days and 10 days), which in turn affects the timing of flowering (Roudier et al., 2011). Corroborating these findings, Englehorn et al., (2007) examined the role of histone methyltransferase specific for H3-K4me3 in chromatin dynamics regulation during floral morphogenesis, supporting the hypothesis that space flight may precipitate accelerated aging in plant cells through epigenetic modifications (Paul et al., 2021).

This body of research lays a robust foundation for future investigations into the molecular mechanisms underpinning plant development and response to environmental factors, highlighting the profound influence of epigenetic modifications and nutrient sensing on growth and development.
