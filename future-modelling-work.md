#### Modelling primary carbon metabolism <a href="#wgts5qgdhf7a" id="wgts5qgdhf7a"></a>

The Response and adaptation of photosynthesis, respiration, and antioxidant systems to elevated CO2 with environmental stress in plants was… The Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle and the photorespiration C2 cycle. The CBB cycle is the main pathway for carbon fixation in photosynthesis. It takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells. The photorespiration C2 cycle is a side pathway of the CBB cycle that occurs when oxygen levels are high. It is less efficient than the CBB cycle and results in the loss of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is fixed by the enzyme RuBisCO, which combines it with ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) to form two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA). 3-PGA is then phosphorylated by ATP to form 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG). 1,3-BPG is then reduced by NADPH to form glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). G3P can either be used to synthesize glucose or other carbohydrates, or it can be recycled back into the CBB cycle.

The photorespiration C2 cycle is when RuBisCO reacts with oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, forming two molecules of phosphoglycolate. Phosphoglycolate is then converted to glycolate by the enzyme glyoxylate reductase. Glycolate is then transported to the peroxisomes, where it is oxidized to glyoxylate and hydrogen peroxide. Glyoxylate is then converted to glycine by the enzyme glycine synthase. Glycine is then transported to the mitochondria, where it is oxidized to serine and carbon dioxide by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase. The photorespiration C2 cycle is a wasteful process that results in the loss of carbon dioxide and the production of hydrogen peroxide. It is more likely to occur in hot, dry conditions, when oxygen levels are high.

**The Calvin–Benson–Basshan (CBB) cycle and photorespiration pathway in plants in response to elevated CO2 with abiotic factors.** Rubisco has two sites of carboxylation and oxygenation. Elevated CO2 (eCO2) may promote carboxylation, but repress oxygenation under ample environmental conditions, such as well-watering, whereas extreme abiotic stress, such as heat and drought, may repress carboxylation but promote oxygenation ([Wingler et al., 1999](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B154); [Tingey et al., 2003](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B141)). An energy consumption trade-off between the key cycles may occur, possibly modified by the CO2 level, in which photorespiration may be promoted to quench reactive oxygen species (ROS), related to glutamine synthetase (GS2) to recycle ammonia, diminishing photo-oxidation and photo-inhibition (dotted orange line ellipse; [Kozaki and Takeba, 1996](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B63); [Watanabe et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B151)). A low Gly:Ser ratio provides evidence that photorespiration is repressed in eCO2([Kebeish et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B59)). Water use efficiency (WUE) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), despite the N dilution, should be enhanced by elevated CO2, by decreasing stomatal conductance and investing relatively more N into the Rubisco protein ([Palmroth et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B107)). The photorespiration process is compartmentalized into the chloroplast (red line ellipse), peroxisome (dotted green line bent rectangle), and mitochondrion (dotted green line ellipse). The green plus and red minus signs denote the stimulation and suppression via rising CO2, respectively (mainly referring to [Kozaki and Takeba, 1996](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B63); [Wingler et al., 1999](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B154); [Tingey et al., 2003](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B141); [Ainsworth and Rogers, 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B5); [Moroney et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B100); [Xu et al., 2013a](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B156); [Watanabe et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B151)).

**outline of the antioxidant defense systems and the responses to elevated CO2 with abiotic stress.** Elevated CO2 may alleviate the damage of oxidative stress from abiotic stress factors, such as heat, drought, and ozone, by ameliorating the antioxidant defense systems of non-enzymatic compounds, potentially including ascorbate (ASC), glutathione (GSH), phenolic compounds, and alkaloids, and the relevant enzymes, possibly including superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), glutathione reductase (GR), peroxidase (POX), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). ROSs, including superoxide radicals (O⋅−2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radicals (OH⋅), and perhydroxy radicals (HO⋅2), accumulate when plants undergo abiotic stress or are senesced by the Fenton reaction and/or the Habere Weiss mechanism ([Hodges and Forney, 2000](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B52); [Gill and Tuteja, 2010](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B45)). Whether the rising CO2mitigates oxidative damage and the response magnitude, and which parts play major roles, depends on the plant species, crop varieties, developmental stage, abiotic factors, and their combinations (e.g., [Hodges and Forney, 2000](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B52); [Gill and Tuteja, 2010](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B45); [Abd Elgawad and Asard, 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B1); [Kumari et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B64); [Zinta et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B167)).

This diagram is based mainly on the studies by [Gill and Tuteja (2010)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B45)and [Zinta et al.

I**soprene biosynthesis downregulation in response to elevated CO2.** Light energy from the sun (1) is transferred into the plant metabolic bioprocesses using an electron transport chain (ETC). Under elevated CO2, more electron flux may be used for the CBB cycle for photosynthesis (2), while less electrons may flow into the photorespiration cycle (3), xanthophyll cycle (4), and the methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway (MEP), (5) to synthesize isoprene (6), as well as other redox reactions, including the quenchers of ROS (7) (based mainly on [Morfopoulos et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00701/full#B96)).



Modelling Cuticular Adaption Starvation.

Cutin biosynthesis, a critical process for plant cuticle formation, involves a sophisticated network of enzymes and transport mechanisms coordinated within the cellular architecture. Key enzymes such as BODYGUARD (BDG), CUTIN SYNTHASEs (CUSs), DEFECTIVE IN CUTICULAR RIDGES (DCR), diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT2), and glycerol-3-phosphatase-CoA acyltransferases (GPATs) play instrumental roles in the synthesis pathway. Additionally, ATP-binding cassette transporters of the G subfamily (ABCGs) are vital for the translocation of cutin monomers. The process is facilitated by specialized structures known as cutinsomes, which are essential for the aggregation and transfer of cutin, while other components like lipid bodies serve as lipid reservoirs, and the endoplasmic reticulum acts as the site for precursor synthesis. Despite the detailed understanding of these components, the precise roles of microtubules, plasmalemma, and potential additional transporters in cutin biosynthesis present areas for further research. This complex orchestration underscores the necessity for continued investigation into the molecular mechanisms driving this essential protective barrier in plants.



Modeling the adaptation to abiotic stress

Although we can broadly generalize about the core metabolism's potential adaptation mechanisms, it’s important to note that the specific effects of elevated CO2 and reduced O2 on plant metabolism can vary depending on various factors such as plant species, crop varieties, developmental stages, and combinations of abiotic stress factors. The effects of abiotic stress on the cell cycle in plants has many consequences. Abiotic stress is caused by environmental factors such as drought, salinity, and heat. It can lead to cell death, senescence, and reduced growth. Abiotic stress activates the oxidative stress response. This response involves the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide. ROS can damage cells and proteins. The cell cycle is arrested in the G2 phase. This is to allow the cell to repair damage and prepare for mitosis. If the damage is too severe, the cell may undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). This is a controlled process that allows the cell to be removed without causing damage to neighboring cells. If the cell survives, the antioxidant system is activated to remove ROS. This system includes enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). The cell cycle then resumes and the plant can continue to grow.

#### Modelling primary carbon metabolism’s response to light in elevated CO2 <a href="#ygy9q9erajm6" id="ygy9q9erajm6"></a>

Their are many different components and pathways involved in photosynthesis. The main pathways are the light reactions and the Calvin cycle. The light reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. They use light energy to split water molecules, releasing oxygen and protons. The protons are used to create a proton gradient, which drives the synthesis of ATP. ATP and NADPH are then used in the Calvin cycle to fix carbon dioxide and produce carbohydrates. The xanthophyll cycleis a biochemical pathway that protect the plant from photodamage by absorbing excess light energy. The MEP pathway is used to produce isoprenoids, which are essential for the production of cell membranes and other compounds. Quenching of ROS involves the removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can damage cells. The ethylene pathway produces a gas that can alter plant growth and development.
