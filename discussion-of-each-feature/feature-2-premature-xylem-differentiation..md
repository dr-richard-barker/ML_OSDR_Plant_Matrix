#### Feature #2: Premature xylem differentiation… <a href="#id-2p6ctfwvp7wf" id="id-2p6ctfwvp7wf"></a>

Feature #2 contains 10 loci (See table 1) and half of which have no protein name so information about their function is sparse. Gene descriptions from TAIR do provide some insights. For example, AT5G56590 represents a gene belonging to the O-Glycosyl hydrolases family 17 protein, an enzyme involved in carbohydrate metabolism in the cell wall and plastids. Another loci, HVA22C, is linked to multiple biological processes such as nuclear function, plasmodesma communication channels, hyperosmotic salinity response, response to ABA (abscisic acid), and drought stress responses (REF). ULT1 (ULTRAPETALA) acts as a TF developmental regulator involved in specifying adaxial-abaxial polarity axis patterns along with determining the apical-basal axis during plant growth (REF). AT2G47680 encodes a zinc finger (CCCH type) helicase family protein known for its involvement in rRNA maturation within the nucleolus compartment of cells (REF).

Some of the genes within Feature #2 were shown to be differentially in response to ionizing radiation by Culligan et al., (2006). For example TRFL10 belongs to the TRF-like family of proteins with literature evidence suggesting links to telomeres (Amiard et al., 2014). DELLA proteins have previously been shown to regulate chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis to help prevent photooxidative damage during seedling deetiolation in Arabidopsis. AT2G18600 encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a role in protein neddylation and SAY1 is a member of the Ubiquitin-like superfamily protein. AT3G51280 codes for a Tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-like protein which has been associated with meristem maintenance and DELLA signaling pathways according to relevant literature sources. If so it is interesting to speculate that AT5G48020” another uncharacterized gene encoding a 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase protein which has been shown to be differentially expressed in response to ionization radiation by Culligan et al. in 2007 could potentially be regulating hormone activity via regulation of GA precusor abundance.

#### Auxin regulation of the balance between expansion and canalisation <a href="#rhn6nppr0ca5" id="rhn6nppr0ca5"></a>

The trafficking of proton pump family proteins is crucial for maintaining pH homeostasis during growth processes in rapidly expanding tissues. Recent discoveries have shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying auxin-induced cell elongation, supporting the relevance of the Acid Growth Theory. The regulation of plasma membrane (PM)-localized "Small Auxin Up Regulated Protein" (SAUR)-PP2C.D modules plays a role in phosphorylation and activity modulation of PM H+-ATPase. Upon auxin induction through the SCFTIR1/AFB pathway, SAUR expression inhibits PP2C.D activity, leading to activation and phosphorylation of PM H+-ATPases. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) influx into root cells triggers a transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels within seconds, contributing to sustained plasma membrane depolarization. This process requires the CNGC14 channel protein and depends on TIR1/AFB receptors (Gámez-Arjona et al., 2022). Furthermore, Serre et al. (2023) recently demonstrated a pH gradient along the root tip of Arabidopsis plants. The distinct acidic and alkaline zones observed on the root surface were found to be influenced not primarily by AHA H+-ATPases activity but rather by coordinated control involving AUX1 auxin influx carrier, AFB1 auxin co-receptor, and CNCG14 calcium channel within the alkaline pH domain located in the root transition zone. These findings collectively provide valuable insights into how proton pump protein trafficking regulates pH homeostasis during tissue growth processes. They also emphasize that SAURs and calcium signaling pathways play central roles in mediating auxin-induced cell expansion responses while underscoring the importance of rapid auxin response modules for efficient navigation of the root tip through their impact on apoplastic pH regulation.

#### Cell Wall pH, Vacuole Morphogenesis, and Auxin Signaling in a Low-pH Rhizosphere and Implications for Spaceflight Conditions" <a href="#id-26w3nbi9jgnb" id="id-26w3nbi9jgnb"></a>

A recent study discovered a close relationship between growth-associated vacuole morphogenesis and cell wall pH changes in response to environmental stress. Acidification of the rhizosphere using low-pH media, as well as through genetic and pharmacological methods, led to an increase in vacuole size in epidermal cells (Batbez et al., 2017)). This connection between vacuole size and cell wall pH was proposed to involve FERONIA (FER), a receptor-like kinase known for its involvement in cell wall mechanosensing. The researchers observed that fer mutants exhibited enlarged vacuoles and epidermal cells, along with impairments in auxin-induced rapid apoplastic alkalization. FER acts as a receptor for specific RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) peptides, triggering autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of the AHA2 PM H+-ATPase. This process is believed to inhibit H+ pumping activity. Additionally, interactions between FER's extracellular domain and a subset of LEUCINE RICH EXTENSINs (LRXs), which are protein components of cell walls was shown to enable RALF binding to calmodulin like 38 (CML38) to allow for integration of secondary messages such as calcium accumulation or waves in the apoplast (Campos et al., 2018). While TIR1/AFB-mediated auxin signaling affects various intracellular processes such as membrane trafficking and vacuolar morphology, further research is necessary to fully comprehend how these changes connect with auxin's control over cell size in the spaceflight environment.

#### Distinct Auxin Regulation Mechanisms in Apical Hook Development of Hypocotyls: Unveiling the Role of TMK1 and Stabilization of IAA32/IAA34 Proteins <a href="#id-8fef6z9ztchh" id="id-8fef6z9ztchh"></a>

The research has also shown a distinctly different mechanism for auxin in regulating apical hook development in hypocotyls. Initially, an auxin maximum on the concave side of the hook inhibits cell expansion, leading to its formation. Over time, a decrease in auxin levels promotes cell expansion and results in the opening of the hook. In this process, the receptor-like kinase TMK1 plays a crucial role by mediating the inhibition of cell expansion induced by auxin in concave apical hook cells. High levels of auxin trigger cleavage of TMK1's kinase domain, which then translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates IAA32 and IAA34 proteins. This phosphorylation leads to transcriptional repression primarily. Unlike other Aux/IAA proteins that are degraded upon exposure to auxin, IAA32 and IAA34 are stabilized by auxin through a TMK1-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, this stabilization occurs independently of TIR1/AFB interactions, suggesting a novel pathway for auxin signaling may be involved specifically in apical hook development. Further research is necessary to understand if similar signaling mechanisms exist for other processes regulated by TMKs and how these receptors perceive and transmit the signal triggered by auxin. Although IAA32 and IAA34 were not identified by the ML analysis a close homologue IAA33 was and due to the relatively large number of etiolated seedlings providing larger proportions of hypocols to the samples it is interesting to wonder if IAA33 is functioning in a similar or redundant manner to IAA32 and IAA34.

#### Cell Wall Adaptation in Spaceflight leads to changes in the Extracellular Matrix Composition that resembles the Plants Pathogen Response <a href="#n5nos4f7crht" id="n5nos4f7crht"></a>

In low oxygen and high CO2 environments, changes occur within carbon metabolism that directly impact components of the cell wall. The plant cell regulates the synthesis of cellulose to adapt its growth to environmental stresses. A reduction in cellulose synthase availability would result in decreased production of cellulose fibers within plant cells' walls potentially leading to alterations required within extracellular matrix protein composition. The synthesis of cellulose at the primary cell wall (Reviewed by Kesten et., 2017) is directly regulated by BIN2, Biotic and abiotic stresses target BIN2 to manipulate the Brassinosteroid (BR) signaling cascade requiring BES1/BEZ1 targeted proteasome degradation and activation of pathogen response genes. One of the consequences of the DAMP/PAMP recognition system is reduction in cellulose synthase activity during periods of stress. Cellulose itself is a source of DAMPs perceived by plant cells as part of a wounding or touch response. Biotic and abiotic stresses alter the cortical microtubule network and thereby affect cellulose synthesis (Kesten et., 2017). The treatment model was also validated by its correlation with a study on plant pathogen response systems (Schikora et al., 2008). In a study by Schikora et al., (2008) study examined the plant defense systems, by monitoring transcript abundance of PR2 and PDF1.2 in response to MeJA treatment and pathogen application. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades also play a crucial role in mediating defense responses to plant pathogen attack. A ROS burst activates defense mechanisms that also indeed callose deposition. This is interesting as many studies have previously shown that space flight stressors affect plants' pathogen response systems (Choi et al., 2019).

#### Changes to Polyamines and Flavonoid Metabolism are part of the Cellular Adaptation and Defense Mechanisms that are altered by spaceflight <a href="#brfcab5oczku" id="brfcab5oczku"></a>

As plants have developed various mechanisms to overcome these stresses on earth, they have a range of mechanisms to allow them to detect the stressors of their external environment, generating appropriate cellular responses, and modulating gene expression and cellular metabolism (Gull et al., 2019). ARACYC analysis reveals pathways involving polyamines, such as spermine and spermidine degradation, as well as flavonoid metabolism which is involved in the product of Rutin. Changes to cellular polyamine metabolism have been implicated in stress responses, as their levels can assist with the preservation of cell membrane integrity, reduced growth inhibition, and increased antioxidant enzyme activities (Gull et al., 2019). The identification of spermine and spermidine degradation pathways suggests that these polyamines may be involved in regulating specific cellular functions related to plant development or stress tolerance (Alcazar et al ., 2020). Flavonols are a class of secondary metabolites that are also known for their antioxidant properties, Rutin is one example of a flavonol compound that has been implicated in various physiological processes within plants including cell wall maturation and defense response (Reviewed by Wang et al., 2022).

#### O-Glycosyl Hydrolases Family 17 Protein in Cell Wall Metabolism and its Connection to Gamma Irradiation-Induced DNA Double Strand Breaks <a href="#id-30atbr7gvt05" id="id-30atbr7gvt05"></a>

Tissue specific expression data predicts O-Glycosyl hydrolases family 17 protein (AT5G56590), the meta-protoxylem and pro-cambian cells in the elongation zone. This protein is a Glucan endo-1, 3-beta-glucosidase that is predicted to function in the plasma membrane and apoplast. This enzyme catalyzes hydrolysis of (1→3)-β-D-glucosidic linkages in (1→3)-β-D-glucans. Known to Hydrolyses laminarin and paramylon. Laminarin is a storage glucan that is a water-soluble polysaccharide that contributes to dietary fiber intake and may help prevent cancer. Laminarin has also been proposed to have antitumor effects. Paramylon is a carbohydrate similar to starch but with a sponge-like structure with many micro-pores. It was originally found in Euglena's chloroplasts, where it is used to store carbohydrates as starch granules and paramylon in order to adjust energy storage density. Changes to these cell wall pathways have been observed previously and endo-glucan metabolism has been shown previously to be perturbed at the transcriptional and glycomics level (Kwon et al., 2015 and Johnson et al, 2017). It is unclear what factor may cause these cell wall components metabolism but it is interesting to note that O-Glycosyl hydrolases family 17 protein is significantly differentially expressed in response to Gamma irradiation (y-IR) induced DNA Double Strand Breaks (DSB). The DSB recognition system medicated by in ATAXIA-TELANGIECTASIA MUTATED (ATM)-dependent phosphorylation of SUPPRESSOR OD GAMMA 1(SOG1), has previously been shown to be master regulator of the DNA damage response (Yoshiyama et al., 2013) and knock out of SOG1 didn’t significantly alter O-Glycosyl hydrolases family 17 protein post Gamma irradiation (y-IR) indicating it is part of the ATM-SOG1 mediated radiation response system.
