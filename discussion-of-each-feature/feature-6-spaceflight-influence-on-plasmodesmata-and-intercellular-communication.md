#### Feature 6: The Role of Plasmodesmata in Intercellular Communication and the Influence of Environmental Factors" <a href="#xhe7sguuk39r" id="xhe7sguuk39r"></a>

The GO cellular site enrichment analysis of Feature 6 reveals enrichments for plasmodesmata and cell-to-cell junctions, emphasizing their importance in intercellular communication. Plasmodesmata serve as channels through which molecules can move between adjacent plant cells. The rate of diffusion through these channels depends on both the density of plasmodesmata and the individual diffusion rate of each channel. Uniform distribution of plasmodesmata allows for even spreading of auxin, a key hormone involved in various physiological processes, throughout a tissue. However, plants exhibit spatial and temporal variations in the number and properties of plasmodesmata, impacting the rate at which molecules diffuse between neighboring cells. This dynamic regulation ensures precise control over intercellular transport pathways (Band, 2021). The influence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on plasmodesmatal conductivity has been explored by the mathematical modeling performed by Band., (2021). Their research suggests that H2O2 may affect auxin movement via these channels, indicating that environmental factors can modulate the conduciveness of plasmodesmata to facilitate molecular transport. Feature #6 in the AWG Matrix focuses specifically on plasmodesmatal function and highlights its potential role as an important final location for byproducts resulting from adaptations to carbon metabolism triggered by spaceflight-related stimuli. However, without single-cell sequencing techniques or detailed investigation into distinct cell types' hydrogen peroxide production's impact on plasmodesmal conductivity remains challenging to ascertain fully. Understanding how environmental factors such as hydrogen peroxide influence plasmodesmata function is crucial for comprehending how plants respond to spaceflight conditions or other stimuli encountered during astrobotany research endeavors. Further studies exploring specific single cellular contexts alongside advancements in experimental techniques will contribute significantly to our understanding of this complex interplay between environmental signals, molecular transport mechanisms, and plant responses.

#### Plasmodesmata are the Gateways for Intercellular Communication and the Integration of Environmental Signals in Plant Physiology <a href="#u396l3y11q75" id="u396l3y11q75"></a>

Plasmodesmata play a critical role in facilitating communication between adjacent plant cells. These microscopic channels connect the cytoplasm of neighboring cells, allowing the exchange of various molecules, including nutrients, hormones, and signaling molecules. The density and properties of plasmodesmata dynamically regulate the rate at which molecules diffuse between cells and their conductivity is highly regulated both spatially and temporally. It is involved in important cellular processes such as carbon metabolism, response to stimuli, and protein localization within the cell wall (Band., 2021). Environmental conditions like light and gravity can influence these processes by modulating plasmodesmatal function. Under stress conditions, auxin flux through plasmodesmata is modulated to optimize meristem size and tissue differentiation in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) signatures generated by environmental stimuli. This modulation allows plants to adapt their growth patterns according to external cues. Callose deposition plays a crucial role in modifying plasmodesmatal diffusion. Callose-mediated reduction in auxin diffusion through plasmodesmata is essential for hypocotyl phototropism and is regulated by changes in auxin distribution. Additionally, callose-mediated reduction in auxin diffusion controls the timing of lateral root emergence influencing overall root architecture (Band, 2021). The anisotropic (directionally dependent) nature of plasmodesmal diffusion affects auxin dynamics not only in leaves but also in roots. This asymmetry contributes to distinct physiological responses depending on tissue location within the plant body (Band, 2021). Interestingly, there exists a feedback loop where auxin influences its own diffusion through plasmodesmataâ€”an intriguing mechanism that further highlights the intricate regulation of this transport pathway to allow for the integration of a plethora of environmental signals. By unraveling these complexities surrounding plasmodesmal diffusion and its involvement with various biological processes such as stress response, phototropism, lateral root emergence, and auxin dynamics, we can enhance our understanding of how plants perceive and respond to their environment.

#### The Interplay between Auxin Transport and Cytokinin Metabolism in spaceflight has Implications for Root Growth, Cell Differentiation, and Tissue Patterning <a href="#id-3p6ug1d5mrjn" id="id-3p6ug1d5mrjn"></a>

Understanding how alterations in auxin transport impact cytokinin metabolism is essential for maintaining a healthy root growth environment. The balance between cell proliferation and differentiation, which is crucial for root development, relies on the proper regulation of auxin transport. Auxin transport is associated with protein localization within the cell wall, and this process can be influenced by environmental conditions such as light and gravity. Cross-talk between these environmental factors and hormone signaling pathways plays a significant role in modulating plant growth responses. Investigating the relationship between alterations in cytokinin abundance and auxin levels by Liu et al., (2022) provides valuable insights into the complex interactions among plant hormones. They found that cytokinin promotes growth cessation in the distal (shootward) elongation zone in conjunction with accelerating the transition from elongation to differentiation. We estimated cell-wall stiffness by using osmotic treatment experiments and found that cytokinin-mediated growth cessation is associated with cell-wall stiffening and requires the action of an auxin influx carrier, AUX1. Evidence suggesting cytokinin degradation under certain circumstances indicates that it may serve as an adaptive mechanism allowing cells to developmentally transition more rapidly towards more differentiation stages of development such as root hairs, guard cells or mature vasculature structures like the xylem and Casparian strip. This acceleration allows them to implement tissue-specific adaptive mechanisms efficiently and ultimately leads to measurable changes in growth and cell-wall mechanical properties at a cellular resolution due to cytokinin influencing cell behaviour to shape tissue patterns (Liu et al., 2022). Another one of the loci identified by the ML precision model is NAC003, this transcription factor is known to be involved in precocious xylem differentiation which results in altered vascular patterning. Heterozygous plants have fewer layers of cambial cells, resulting in occasional intercalated phloem and xylem cells, while Homozygous plants display intercalated phloem and xylem, with no identifiable cambial cell (Reviewed by Sun et al. , 2020).
