# Feature 0: Hormonal signal integration through TOPLESS and CPK4

#### Feature 0: Hormonal signal integration through a TOPLESS Regulated Ras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor Q-like Protein in Plant Adaptation to spaceflight <a href="#zhgk0euzqfd" id="zhgk0euzqfd"></a>

Feature 0, is the name less AT5G57340, is a ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor Q-like protein. The loci is responsive to salt, cold and osmotic stress and its protein has been detected as part of a physical interactome regulated by TOPLESS (Causier et al., (2012) as part of a multi-horme signal integration system including abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinin, jasmonates (JA), Salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene. It remains unclear what role TOPLESS and its interactome play in coordinating and decoding environmental monitoring and response systems in the spaceflight environment. Interestingly incorporating this feature with 15 other loci from features (2, 3, 4, 5, 7) for enrichment analysis using GSAD, identified as a significant association was also found with the “Growth Regulating Factor” GRF1/GRF2/GRF3 triple mutant. The GRF family comprises 9 members and the first three members GRF1/GRF2/GRF3 have been shown to be involved in the synchronization of developmental processes and defense signaling (Liu et al., 2014). Piya et al., (2020) also show that the growth-stress response antagonism is in part mediate via contrasting interactions of GRF1 and GRF3. They identified several genes associated with the biosynthesis of different hormones, including cytokinin, brassinosteroid, auxin, gibberellin, salicylic acid, ethylene, and jasmonic acid. These hormones work together to coordinate plant growth through changes in cell division, elongation and apoptosis in part through regulation of the GRF genes.

#### Decoding the Functions of IAA13 and ARF10 in Nuclear Import Processes Associated with Gene Regulation during seed germination" <a href="#sj2bxss5s36a" id="sj2bxss5s36a"></a>

IAA13 and ARF10 are part of the "Knetminer precision network," indicating their involvement in nuclear import processes associated with gene regulation. These proteins play crucial roles in plant growth and development forming different heterodimers (Piya et al., 2014). IAA (Aux/IAA) proteins function as transcriptional regulators that modulate various aspects of plant physiology, including hormone signaling pathways. They are involved in the regulation of auxin responses, controlling processes such as cell elongation, differentiation, tropisms, and organogenesis. IAA13 specifically plays a role in root development and lateral root formation. ARF (Auxin Response Factor) proteins act downstream of IAA proteins to regulate gene expression in response to auxin signals. They bind to specific DNA sequences known as AuxREs (auxin response elements), thereby activating or repressing target genes involved in diverse physiological processes like embryogenesis, vascular development, floral initiation, fruit ripening, and senescence. The association of IAA13 and ARF10 with nuclear import remains unclear; this process may adjust if hypoxia or other stress signals may lead to changes in these transcription factors altering gene expression in different ways at distinct developmental stages incorporating different positional signals from auxin transport signals. The role ARF10 plays in seed dormancy requires the ABA signaling pathway (and vice versa), indicating that the roles of auxin and ABA in seed dormancy are interdependent. Auxin perception acts upstream of the major regulator of seed dormancy, ABI3, by recruiting the auxin response factors AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 10 (ARF10) along with ARF16 to control the expression of ABI3 during seed germination (Liu et al., 2013). Therefore it’s interesting to speculate that the detection of IAA13 by the precision model may indicate that the spaceflight treatment might affect seed germination rates.

#### CPK4: The Nexus of Calcium, ABA, IAA Signaling, and Auxin Transport in Plant Stress Responses and Growth Regulation <a href="#aj3sgx5uua3d" id="aj3sgx5uua3d"></a>

CPK4 has a significant role in calcium-mediated ABA (abscisic acid) signaling pathways related to abiotic stress responses. This protein is primarily located on the plasma membrane of cells. CPK4 has been shown to function as a positive regulator within ABA signaling cascades by phosphorylating ABA-responsive transcription factors (Zhu et al., 2007). This phosphorylation event leads to enhanced binding affinity between these transcription factors and their target genes' promoters. As a result, CPK4 contributes to increased stress tolerance by triggering specific molecular responses mediated by ABA-regulated genes. Under osmotic stress conditions, CPK4 accumulates within root cells where it exerts its regulatory effects on ABA signaling pathways. The turnover rate of CPK4 is tightly regulated by the PUB44 ubiquitin ligase, ensuring precise control over its activity (Fan et al., 2023). In terms of enzymatic activities, CPK4 exhibits calcium-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity and can bind to calmodulin. These features enable CPK4 to integrate intracellular calcium signals and phosphorylate downstream targets involved in ABA signaling pathways. CPK4 demonstrates a distinct expression pattern, being prominently expressed in rapidly elongating tissues such as root hairs, the elongation zone, and the shoot apical meristem. This localization suggests its crucial role in regulating growth processes within these specific regions of plant tissues as shown by high-resolution temporal expression maps (Brady et al., 2007). Knetminer knowledge network analysis (Figures XX) allows us to explore CPK4 is a potential regulatory hub known to coordinate responses using signals from the calcium signaling pathway to influence IAA signaling (through interactions with ABF1) and IAA transport pathway via physical interactions with PIN7 and TOC33 (Translocation of the outer membrane of the chloroplast). PIN7 plays an important role in directing auxin through the columella cells of the root tip and is involved in maintaining a reverse fountain of auxin around the root's quiescent center. TOC33 is expressed in the root vasculature and ground tissue of the root meristem, although not directly linked to TOC132-ARG1-LAZY (Nishimura et al., 2023) medicated gravity perception process in the columella cells may play a similar signaling role in these different tissues for alternative stimuli.
