The nuclear pores embedded in the nuclear envelope serve as exclusive gateways for macromolecular trafficking between the nucleus and cytoplasm. These pores are large protein complexes made up of approximately 30 different nucleoporins. The movement of proteins and RNAs through these nuclear pore complexes relies on the coordination between nuclear transport receptors, nucleoporins, and elements of the Ran GTPase cycle. Besides facilitating directional import and export of molecules, the nuclear pore complex also plays a role in cellular processes like sumoylation and desumoylation. Specific nucleoporins and subcomplexes within the nuclear pore exhibit distinct localization during mitosis and contribute to various functions such as kinetochore regulation, spindle assembly, and checkpoint control.

NTLs are also known as NAC family transcription factors that contain a conserved N-terminal sequence, along with a transmembrane (TM) motif. The ARAMEMNON protein database predicts that there are about 13 NTLs in Arabidopsis which have been implicated in a range of processes. Liang et al., (2015) show that AtNTL7, also known as NTF2-LIKE, can be found in the endomembrane system and contributes to ER-stress resistance in Arabidopsis. Sugimoto et al., (2022) showed that NTL9 negatively regulates Arabidopsis vascular cambium development during stem secondary growth. Wu _et al._, (2023) used a mutant allele of NTL known as NAC014C constitutively activating heat stress response by inducing the expression of heat-responsive genes that were dependent or not on the HSF (heat stress transcription factor). Further analysis showed NAC014 was a direct regulator of the DREB2-HSFA3 module and bound to the promoters of HSFA3A, HSFA3B, and DREB2B to activate their expressions. Thus, LlNAC014 increased thermotolerance by sensing high temperature and translocating to the nucleus to activate the DREB2-HSFA3 module (Wu et al., 2023).

It is well established that essential processes such as photorespiration are performed by interconnected metabolic pathways within mitochondria and chloroplasts. There are many possible routes of cross talk between these organelles such as direct exchange of RNA or small signaling molecules and even physical interactions between organelles surface. ABI4 has been defined as a negative regulator of AOX1a based on an analysis of two abi4 mutant backgrounds in which AOX1a was de-repressed. Itâ€™salso been shown that the ABI4 binding to the promoter region of AOX1a; This led to the early identification of 24 mitochondrial dysfunction stimulon (MDS) genes based on their high induction when mitochondrial function was impaired in ANA013 (De Clercq et al., 2013). This work, together with a forward genetic screen for regulators of the mitochondrial stress marker gene ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE 1A (AOX1A), also part of the MDS, revealed several key transcription factors (TFs) including involved in this regulation in Arabidopsis.

#### Membrane Trafficking: Modifying Plasma Membrane through Vesicle Docking <a href="#c7hjoces27gm" id="c7hjoces27gm"></a>

There are many signaling pathways that play a crucial role in connecting stress sensing with biochemical, subcellular and physiological responses in plants (Gull et al., 2019). Changes in endomembrane trafficking have a significant impact on the modification of cell wall composition leading to changes in morphology. Another NAC family protein identified by our Treatment model known as ANAC017 also plays a role in regulating mitochondrial proteotoxic stress. He et al., (2022) have also previously demonstrated that the 'classical' mitochondrial retrograde signaling system is mediated by ER-anchored transcription factor ANAC017. The process of aerobic respiration leads to the release of byproducts from respiration and photosynthesis into the endomembrane system and it bye products ultimately end up in the apoplast or vacuole; so in spaceflight environments the altered carbon metabolism, potentially due to low oxygen and/or elevated CO2 environments, influences many metabolic processes. These changes affect the availability of cellulose synthase, potentially necessitating alterations in extracellular matrix protein composition. Membrane trafficking, including processes such as vesicle docking and plasmodesmata-mediated plasma membrane modifications, plays a crucial role in regulating cellular activities related to cell wall dynamics. Alterations in these trafficking mechanisms can lead to modifications in the composition and structure of the cell wall.

Cutin and suberin are lipophilic polymer matrices that form barriers in the cell walls of plants. These barriers control the movement of gasses, water, and solutes, and also protect plants from biotic and abiotic stresses. The process of cutin delivery to the apoplast is a complex one that involves a number of different proteins and enzymes. The first step is the production of cutin monomers in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These monomers are then transported to the plasmalemma, where they are assembled into cutin polymers by cutin synthases. Some of the cutin synthases are located in the plasmalemma itself, while others are located in vesicles called cutinsomes. Cutinsomes are small, membrane-bound organelles that are thought to play a role in the transport of cutin monomers to the plasmalemma. Once the cutin is assembled, it is transported to the apoplast by a group of proteins called ABCG transporters. ABCG transporters are ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters that are specifically involved in the transport of cutin. The apoplast is the extracellular space outside of the cell wall. It is a continuous pathway that surrounds all of the cells in a plant. Cutin is deposited in the apoplast, where it forms a protective layer that helps to prevent water loss and protect the plant from pathogens. The exact mechanism of cutin delivery to the apoplast is still not fully understood. However, the diagram you sent me provides a good overview of the different proteins and enzymes that are involved in this process.

#### Composition and Formation of the Plant Cuticle: Insights into the Roles of Cutin, Waxes, and Associated Compounds <a href="#vvefj2olot5l" id="vvefj2olot5l"></a>

The cuticle is a layer of waxy material that covers the outer surface of plant leaves, stems, and fruits. It helps to prevent water loss, protect plants from pathogens, and regulate gas exchange. The cuticle is composed of two main components: cutin and waxes. Cutin is a polyester polymer that is made up of hydroxy fatty acids. Waxes are hydrophobic molecules that are embedded in the cutin matrix. The cutin polymer is formed by the activities of two enzymes: CUS1 and cutin:cutin acyl transferase (CCAT). CUS1 is a protein from the multigenic GDSL family of esterase/lipase. It catalyzes the first step in cutin synthesis, which is the formation of a 2-monoacylglycerol from a fatty acid and glycerol. CCAT is a protein that catalyzes the esterification of 2-monoacylglycerol with another fatty acid. This reaction forms the polyester network of cutin. The figure also shows that para-coumaric acid can be esterified to the primary alcohol group of HOFA. This reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme of the multigenic BAHD family. Para-coumaric acid is a phenolic compound that is found in many plants. It is thought to help to strengthen the cutin polymer and make it more resistant to degradation. The figure also shows that flavonoids can be associated with cutin. Flavonoids are another type of phenolic compound that is found in many plants. They are thought to help to protect the cuticle from UV radiation and other environmental stresses. The cutin polymer is associated with the cuticle-embedded polysaccharides (CEP) by non-covalent bonds. The CEP is composed of crystalline cellulose, highly esterified pectins, and acetylated xyloglucans. These polysaccharides are thought to help to strengthen the cuticle and make it more resistant to abrasion. The cutin network and CEP form gradients in the cuticle thickness. This creates a spatial heterogeneity in the plant cuticles. The thickness of the cuticle varies depending on the plant species, the environmental conditions, and the age of the plant. In summary, the cutin chemistry in plant cell walls is a complex and dynamic process. The cutin polymer is formed by the activities of several enzymes, and it is associated with a variety of other compounds, including waxes, flavonoids, and polysaccharides. The cutin network and CEP form gradients in the cuticle thickness, which creates a spatial heterogeneity in the plant cuticles (Reviewed by Yeats and Rose 2013).
